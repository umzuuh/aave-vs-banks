# Weekly Federal Reserve Bank Data Scraper Plan

## Overview
Automated system to scrape top 40 U.S. commercial banks data from Federal Reserve HTML table on a weekly basis.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. HTML Parser Development
- Parse HTML table structure for bank rankings
- Extract key fields: Rank, Bank Name, Holding Company, Location, Assets
- Handle table formatting variations and edge cases

### 2. Weekly Scheduler System
- Cron job or scheduled task for weekly execution
- Configurable timing (e.g., every Monday 6 AM)
- Time zone handling for consistent execution

### 3. Data Pipeline Architecture
```
HTML Source → Parser → Validator → Storage → Change Detection → Notifications
```

### 4. Data Validation & Quality Checks
- Verify 40 banks are captured
- Validate asset amounts and rankings
- Cross-reference with previous week's data
- Flag anomalies or missing data

### 5. Storage & Versioning
- JSON/CSV format for structured data
- Weekly snapshots with timestamps
- Historical data retention policy
- Database or file-based storage options

### 6. Change Detection System
- Compare week-over-week rankings
- Identify new entrants/exits from top 40
- Track significant asset changes (>5%)
- Generate change reports

### 7. Error Handling & Monitoring
- Retry logic for network failures
- Backup data sources if HTML unavailable
- Email/Slack notifications for failures
- Health check endpoints

### 8. Configuration Management
- Environment-specific settings
- Source URL configuration
- Notification preferences
- Data retention policies

## Technical Stack Options
- **Python**: BeautifulSoup, requests, schedule/APScheduler
- **Node.js**: Puppeteer/Playwright, node-cron, cheerio
- **Container**: Docker for deployment consistency

## Weekly Schedule Considerations
- Federal Reserve typically updates quarterly
- Weekly checks catch any interim updates
- Avoid high-traffic periods (market hours)
- Include retry windows for temporary failures
